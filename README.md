# SmartLicensePlateDetection

## üöó **Project Overview**  
SmartLicensePlateDetection is a machine learning-based solution designed for real-time detection and recognition of vehicle license plates from images or video streams. The system utilizes **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)** for efficient object detection and integrates **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to extract text from license plates. The extracted plate numbers are automatically saved into a database for easy retrieval and further processing.

This solution can be used in various applications including:
- Traffic monitoring systems
- Parking management
- Toll collection
- Law enforcement and surveillance
